In this episode, we’re speaking to Liran Tal, director of developer advocacy at Snyk, about how his team makes use of DevRel.\r\n\r\nLiran is a big believer in empathy, and infuses it into every aspect of his developer advocacy work. It’s a theme that has come up repeatedly on the podcast recently, and Liran is another proponent of empathy being at the centre of how we engage with developers.\r\n\r\nLike many people, Liran came through the engineering pipeline, and made the jump to DevRel when he started at Snyk, but he explains why this “jump” was actually more of a step, as he had already used his engineering work to initiate community events and public speaking opportunities, so DevRel felt like a natural place to take those skills.\r\n\r\nAs an engineer using JavaScript and open source, Liran began to see the immense value of a hive-like community, connecting hundreds, or thousands of people to collaborate and share information, and he knew he wanted to live in that space. And luckily, as he explains, no one needs permission to start being a DevRel. No matter what specific area you work in, you can stealthily start practising public speaking, or building communities, and then when you’re ready to officially start looking for that DevRel job, you’ll already have some idea of what you’re doing.\r\n\r\nLiran speaks about the “DevRel’ ladder, and the common question of how those who want to can climb it. DevRel is one of those fields with endless room to grow. You may start out knowing nothing about the technical side, and end up with a whole new set of skills that are now available to you.

He speaks about the culture of DevRel, how all too often a singular person gets hired to do the work of an entire DevRel team, both code and community, and how this overload leads to the inevitable cycle of burnout that he sees frequently.\r\n\r\nWe also chat to him about his work as a senior developer advocate at Elasticsearch, where he had the benefit of a large developer team working with a popular product that had insane traction. He says that Elasticsearch is a classic example of how DevRel can work when the founders are the first developer advocates.\r\n\r\nAravind is also a speaker who has given talks at many large conferences, and he tells us a little about how he coordinates a team where five people have all signed up to speak at the same conference.

Aravind speaks to us about his transition from DevRel to angel investing and his propensity for startups and working with founders.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the world of consulting, Aravind walks us through his role with a company, from strategy, to marketing, to introducing their brand to the public as a DevRel. He speaks about the culture of DevRel, how all too often a singular person gets hired to do the work of an entire DevRel team, both code and community, and how this overload leads to the inevitable cycle of burnout that he sees frequently.\r\n\r\nWe also chat to him about his work as a senior developer advocate at Elasticsearch, where he had the benefit of a large developer team working with a popular product that had insane traction. He says that Elasticsearch is a classic example of how DevRel can work when the founders are the first developer advocates.\r\n\r\nAravind is also a speaker who has given talks at many large conferences, and he tells us a little about how he coordinates a team where five people have all signed up to speak at the same conference.

Wesley has us covered in this department.\r\n\r\nWe get straight into one of the biggest issues DevRel has faced in 2023: layoffs. We’ve talked about it a lot this year, which isn’t surprising considering the almost fifteen per cent cut in DevRel jobs. It’s not something we haven’t been through before, but it still has quite the effect on morale. Wesley discusses this practice of “trimming the fat” that is beloved by CFOs in times of high interest rates. And we can see why. On the surface, it’s simple - sure, you lose a few talented people, but you also lose those pesky salary payments that have been weighing down the budget.\r\n\r\nBut in these situations we must ask ourselves why DevRel is seen as such an easy target. As Richard tells Wesley, he’s often wondered why DevRel must spend so much time justifying its existence, but Marketing and Sales and Customer Service departments don’t have to.\r\n\r\nAccording to Wesley, what DevRel needs is to make the PR machine work for us. When the people at the Harvard Business Review, and other publications decide to write about us, others will follow. We can see where he’s coming from. Tech people are like magpies, they like to collect shiny things. Whatever's cool, whatever’s trending.

As Richard tells Wesley, he’s often wondered why DevRel must spend so much time justifying its existence, but Marketing and Sales and Customer Service departments don’t have to.\r\n\r\nAccording to Wesley, what DevRel needs is to make the PR machine work for us. When the people at the Harvard Business Review, and other publications decide to write about us, others will follow. We can see where he’s coming from. Tech people are like magpies, they like to collect shiny things. Whatever's cool, whatever’s trending. So if there are any celebrity publicists out there looking for a new client, I think DevRel might just need your help.\r\n\r\nReach out to Wesley here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/wesley83/\r\n\r\nCheck out Wesley’s podcast: https://www.justworktogether.com/podcast-season-2/episode-1\r\n\r\nFind out more and listen to previous podcasts here: https://www.voxgig.com/podcast\r\n\r\nSubscribe to our newsletter for weekly updates and information about upcoming meetups: \r\nhttps://voxgig.substack.com/\r\n\r\nJoin the Dublin DevRel Meetup group here: www.devrelmeetup.com","guid":"d135e24c-91dc-40bb-9b54-3041d98b580b","isoDate":"2023-11-08T15:00:00.000Z","itunes":{"subtitle":"On this episode of the podcast Richard speaks to Wesley Faulkner.

It’s a problem that plagues DevRel and tech companies, as well as just about any business that has a social media presence. So what can we do about it?\r\n\r\nWell, this is where Outcaster comes in. It’s a platform that allows individuals and companies to create progressive web apps that will collate their content into a one-stop-shop. This allows you to curate all of your content directly, rather than having to tailor all different messaging for all different channels.

Outcaster removes the burden of this task.\r\n\r\nNiall tells us a little about his history, from developer, to startup employee, to startup co-founder. He talks about the inevitability of audience loss when switching platforms (it’s not you, it’s just the system), but how this might not always be a bad thing. While audience loss seems like a setback, it also gives you an opportunity to focus more on the members that you’ve retained, and pour the support they’ve given you back into the community.\r\n\r\nThis was a fascinating discussion that will ring true for all the multi-channel posting people out there.

Vaunt’s goal is to streamline these processes into a more efficient set of steps.\r\n\r\nThey also speak on what they believe is missing from GitHub, and how having developers on your side is an asset that won’t be going out of style anytime soon.\r\n\r\nReach out to Ethan here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/elewis787/\r\nAnd Simon here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/simoncheng-kc/\r\n\r\nCheck out Vaunt.dev’s services here:‍ https://vaunt.dev/\r\n\r\nFind out more and listen to previous podcasts here: https://www.voxgig.com/podcast\r\n\r\nSubscribe to our newsletter for weekly updates and information about upcoming meetups: https://voxgig.substack.com/\r\n\r\n\r\nJoin the Dublin DevRel Meetup group here: www.devrelmeetup.com","guid":"93eb232f-3e7c-4089-bcfb-dce70ffb5e36","isoDate":"2023-10-17T07:00:00.000Z","itunes":{"subtitle":"Today we’re joined by Ethan Lewis and Simon Cheng, CTO and DevRel of Vaunt.dev for a discussion on how their work enables individuals and companies to nurture their open source communities.

As Richard knows all too well, startups require everyone to become a multi-hyphenate. But even in bigger organisations, with a whole team surrounding you, the work of a developer advocate can never be categorised simply.

You’ll see why people skills are a must-have. \r\n\r\nAs we mentioned, Rohit has built up an impressive network across a variety of social media platforms.

Hiring someone with a high follower count may get your company some engagement, but it doesn’t mean that the person themselves will gel with your team.\r\n\r\nHe also has some great insights on the point of internal vs external hiring. What are the pros and cons of both? When it comes to speaking, he prefers to bring in people who already possess those skills.

His partner Catherine had a wealth of conference experience, so they decided to collaborate. They created UXDX, under the principle of connecting people from across every stage of the development process.\r\n\r\nRory talks about how the attendees of UXDX may work in a huge number of different fields, but underneath it all, they’re all united by a common interest - getting things done. It’s what the conference is all about.

It sounds simple, but we think this system is a gem that will soon be spreading to other companies. Listen to Joe explain HOW they implement this system.","guid":"d658c665-f003-4259-8fe9-48aa7fb5fbc6","isoDate":"2023-08-31T04:00:00.000Z","itunes":{"subtitle":"Joe Pettersson joins the podcast, to talk all things devrel at banked.com.

She tells us all about her company, The Remote Speaker Coach, and her journey to founding it. While working on education projects, Danielle kept running into the same problem; she was meeting people with great ideas and amazing knowledge about their subjects, but when they got up onstage to speak - they froze. Sound familiar?\r\n\r\nAs someone who trained in theatre, Danielle knew she had the skills to help these speakers tighten up their talks, and bring the audience in with their presentation, rather than alienating them - an extra challenge when speaking remotely. It’s not just taking out an “um” here and an “ah” there, instead Danielle has a clear and systematic approach to maximising your talk to its full potential. As it turns out, a lot of this comes down to structure. After all, even though you're not performing a piece of fiction, you are still telling a story. And a story needs a beginning, middle and end.

She’s worked with speakers that have decided their talk should last for sixty minutes. Danielle says, why? What are you trying to say, and is there a way you can say it in forty-five minutes instead? It’s not simply about cutting time. It’s about streamlining, about keeping that momentum going and only including the most important information necessary to get your message across.\r\n\r\nAll this said, speaking is a highly individual craft, something Danielle emphasises. It’s important to listen to advice, but equally to assess your own weaknesses and strengths. What’s going to make you feel your best before speaking? Are you someone who benefits from keeping focused on yourself, or do you feed off the energy of a crowd? Knowing what works for you is a key piece of information in putting together speeches, and building a routine for when you get up onstage.

As someone who works with words, how does she market towards people who work with numbers? Anna and Flagsmith find ways to bridge the divide with their work helping companies eliminate risk and increase efficiency in their development process.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to say about Flagsmith is that it's obvious they know how to market.

It’s the simple truth that no-one wants a stack of flashy adverts dropped in their inbox - spam folders were invented for a reason!\r\n\r\nSo Flagsmith avoids speaking down to developers, instead it simply gets on their level. It’s a thin line to walk. Avoid jargon, but don’t simplify your language to the point of vagueness. Be specific, but keep things accessible to someone just glancing at your materials. If you’ve ever seen an advert or a piece of marketing that made you physically cringe, you’ll know that it’s a challenging task.\r\n\r\nLastly, Richard broaches that awkward preconceived notion held by us all; if a product is good, I’ll hear about it! Why does it even need marketing?

With a background in economics that became a career in sales and marketing, Jonathan realised that developers had a huge influence over the products their companies ended up purchasing.

Few people would know better than Jonathan and the team at crowd.dev, as not only do they specialise in finding revenue opportunities for open source companies, they’re an open source company themselves.\r\n\r\nLike many of us, Jonathan stumbled into the world of developer relations, meetups and open source products somewhat by accident. With a background in economics that became a career in sales and marketing, Jonathan realised that developers had a huge influence over the products their companies ended up purchasing. If he wanted those developers onside, the product had to be open source - from there, he co-founded crowd.dev and the rest is history.\r\n\r\nHe also informs me about a system called ‘accounts-based marketing’ that crowd.dev has had a lot of success with. How do you prove that your services are either making or saving money for a business? Accounts-based marketing is a new way for companies like crowd.dev to get proper attribution from customers, and display the value they add to the companies they work for.\r\n\r\nFor anyone interested in the nitty-gritty of life as an open source company, this one's for you.","guid":"07024386-ebb7-4bb9-b83c-6b0d1fa79295","isoDate":"2023-08-10T09:10:00.000Z","itunes":{"subtitle":"This time we welcome Jonathan Reimer to the podcast.

Can your software scale with your business? Natalie explains that the Software Craftsmanship mission is to raise the bar in the software industry through professionalism and technical excellence.

A lot of people want to focus on quality and are proud of what they do, so a space for them to share and come together without a commercial reason allows new tech ideas to be born. An important aspect of preventing things to feel commercially driven is in your approach to content – are you producing resources and content people need and want rather than just selling stuff?\r\nDevRel measuring gets touched on again, specifically on community, how do you know its sustainable?

Sid’s role is to improve their explanation and communication of their SDKs and APIs. \r\n\r\nThis includes a glorious description of a date format fix got softly rolled out to “hide” technical debt through a SDK.

For Peter, the biggest lesson any speaker can learn is resilience.\nLearn more about Peter Hopwood here.\nTo get a weekly dose of public speaking tips, information, videos of great talks, conference news, book reviews and more, sign up to the Voxgig newsletter.\nWe’re proud to partner with Simplecast to bring you our Fireside with Voxgig podcast.\nView all show notes, links, and more brilliant public speaking resources at voxgig.com.\nIf you like what you hear on Fireside with Voxgig, don’t be shy―tell everyone!

Bonnie describes herself as a “Amsterdam-based American European”. She’s also an actor and a TEDx speaker coach, and was featured in Marie Claire magazine.<br />\nBonnie has worked for many years helping business people apply the skills of acting to the corporate world. She tells us how engaging with intercultural differences is so important for people doing business outside their own country. However, she shies away from using terms “training” and “coaching”. What she focuses on with clients, she reveals, is “connecting speakers to their message”. Her overarching goal, she says, and the thing she loves doing most, is “helping people be the best they can be”.<br />\nBonnie also delves into the subject of networking. She advises aspiring public speakers not to underestimate the power of “who you know”. A lot of her clients, she tells us, struggle with exposure; getting out there and meeting people is key at events like festivals, conferences, or just standing at the bar somewhere! She has a nice alternative take on the traditional “elevator pitch”; she calls it “cocktail pitching”, which is much more about a conversation. Bonnie gives us valuable insights into how speakers can make casual connections.</p>\n<p>Learn more about Bonnie <a href=\"http://www.thewholepackage.nl/about-bonnie\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>We’re proud to partner with https://simplecast.com/ to bring you our Fireside with Voxgig podcast.</p>\n<p>To get a weekly dose of public speaking tips, information, videos of great talks, conference news, book reviews and more, sign up to the <a href=\"https://www.voxgig.com/%7Ec/newsletter/\">Voxgig newsletter</a>.</p>\n<p>View all show notes, links, and more brilliant public speaking resources at <a href=\"https://www.voxgig.com/\">voxgig.com. </a></p>\n<p>If you like what you hear on Fireside with Voxgig, don’t be shy―tell everyone!
