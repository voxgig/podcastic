We talk to people in the developer community about developer relations public speaking, and community events. For more details, visit fox gig.com/ podcast. Alright. Let's get started. Charlie Robbins is old school, and I say that with the deepest affection. If you want to find out what really happened when Mode burst onto the scene and managed to establish itself as a brand new software development platform. We take a deep dive into the wise and wherefors. Essential listening, if you're trying to establish your own proprietary or indeed open source platform today. And that was just the first topic. We cover a whole bunch of ground. Alright, Charlie. Let's talk. Charlie. Welcome to the Fireside of FoxGeek podcast. It is great to have you on. And to be talking again since, I think, well, pre COVID times. Yeah. Oh, definitely it's before COVID. So I invited you on because you had a front row seat to the early days of node. And how it took over the world and the setup of various foundations, and all of that stuff, and what fascinates me from a developer relations perspective is, why on earth did no JS managed somehow to take over the world. I mean, Ryan Dial did an amazing It's funny. Now that I think about it in in terms of DevRel or Dev advocacy, because my entry into node is a direct result of a complete and utter lack of that failure of that on behalf of Microsoft, back then. I Started my career at Microsoft. I worked on a very old, very dead piece of technology called Windows Presentation Foundation. Although, for the Microsoft dot net folks listening to this, probably not as old and dead as I'm saying it is, but this is, you know, 2005, 2006, and I drank the Kool Aid Heart. I worked at Microsoft right out of school, I worked on these things called X Baps, SAML based applications that ran inside of, active x in inner explorer. So really, like, webappifying it already. And then I went on to work, after the financial crash, paradoxically, I went into financial services, financial software consulting because as, my old boss, who, is now actually the CEO and founder of Greenhouse used to say consultants thrived at a downturn. And so this technology that was very new, the Microsoft was selling to everyone, WPF several light. I had, you know, light years more experience than other people. So I I was working with people, you know, 10, 12 years my senior on very notable pieces of financial software that, obviously, I can't talk about sort of who's and what's, but you name a a large bank here in the US and chances are it was a large front end application for their trading desk. And in doing so, we would find bugs and features, for some of these things that were It's called the source available, not open source. And I've worked at Microsoft, mind you. So sort of the tipping point for me, and if you go look at my GitHub profile, it's probably one of the oldest repositories that's there. It was adding support for an insertable, interface on of, I'm sure, a very old dead framework of theirs. I think Blue's called Prism. And I've got it all together. You know, all the code, all the tests, and submitted my, you know, mercurial based, not even pull request to code plex. Only to be told that, they only accept changes from Microsoft employees. And that was sort of the end for me. I I didn't want, you know, I did it. I knew that it was right because I've been in my soft employee, and it's what they wanted. And sort of the, like, you know, beyond the CLA, which is, I know, a topic that comes up a lot in foundations of, like, we just literally we don't even have a CLA. We're just gonna say, if you don't work for us, we're done. And so I I flipped my table out, I was obviously polite about it, but I was like, okay. Well, if that's where you want me to put it, then, I can tell you where to put something else. You know? I was a GitHub user of 4628 or something like that. And it that was, like, the same week that all of this happened. And my roommate at the time was had been kind of the same as me, but all of these JavaScript. And I, you know, didn't really know JavaScript. I was like, oh, this prototype thing. That seems weird. And, then I think probably the month later was rise talk at JS Compu, so November 2009, and the, like, night and day of, like, community, like, the idea of it, or, like, people just like, I'm doing this. That's cool. I'm doing this. I'm doing this other thing, and we, you know, just open free discourse about it versus, you know, the guarded walls of code plex that I had experienced was really the reason I got into it. And from there, it solidified my thinking that I must have told this story to investors and, you know, tons of people more times than I can count, but it was this thing that Microsoft was reporting would be, like, the next coming of, dot net was gonna die. And so, therefore, Flash and PLEX were gonna die. And this was before we knew that the iPhone was gonna kill Flash. So this thing that everyone kinda, like, laughs off called JavaScript, that's gonna win the front end. And when I had been doing all this work with these large banks, they loved the idea of one language. They love the, like, c sharp footage They would. Back end. Yeah. They would. Yeah. Here comes this, like, JavaScript back end that everyone thinks is a joke. That's gonna take over. That's gonna be the largest programming platform in the planet, and this was 2009 that I was thinking this. And by the time that We started the No JS Foundation. I remember having this conversation with Michael Rogers. I was like, oh, we are the largest programming platform on the planet. We are. This is, like, 2015. Like, we are. The way it is. We have to just, like, find the numbers to prove that it is, but, like, we know that it is. And it was like, oh, I think it was NPM downloads compared to Maven downloads or something like that, but JavaScript had long been the number one language on GitHub. But, Charlie, was it just that basic structural reason that JavaScript is the language of the browser? Did that make it Something's gotta win. There's there's a bit of a oligopoly to it of, like, where is their presentation stack? You know, why are we not all writing QT? Right? And But what it doesn't explain for me is why was the community so strong? That has to be a huge part of it. You know, in the early 20 tens, I have the same experience as you coming from Jeff. From this really strict clinical approach to, hey, do whatever you like. You know, let's be creative. Yeah. I think it's the creativity part of it. And this is what I try to bring into engineer organizations that I work with now in my client base. Engineers are far more creative than people give them credit for. I think oftentimes you could hear sort of software engineer and accountant and think that it's, sort of the same same thing and that they're not at all. Sorry for all the accountants out there. Maybe I'm I'm oversimplifying for you. You maybe really do wanna be a line tamer and modify someone's right. But, engineers are are it's it's a very creative thing to go do. And most people get convinced that they aren't creative because their ideas get squashed prematurely. They don't have that a time to be like, well, this is I mean, I probably remember this term mad science. Right? This is kinda crazy. I don't know if it's gonna work. But I'm gonna work on this for a couple of days, and I'm gonna see if this is gonna work. Like, I don't know, a process monitor in pure JavaScript. That's kind of a crazy idea, but once you implement the c interface for detached child processes in, you know, ABB, it works. And, you know, it still has issues that, like, Upstart Vonet don't have because they're, like, baked into the operating system when they start, but once it's going, your operating system is good. And you put it in your upstart or monoscript, like, it works. And, I think if I was gonna do it all over again, I don't know if I write forever, but I certainly learned a lot writing it, and I'm a learn by doing kind of person. And I think that was the other part of it is that there were a lot of people in those early groups that were learned by doing. And that sort of, like, well, I don't know if that's gonna work, and I only know if it's gonna work if I see it working. So I might as well just try and make it work. Like, should I rewrite this very complex CHTP header parser in JavaScript? I don't know. But why don't I do it four times? And I'll see if it's faster. And there was always acceptance, wasn't there? It seems to me. They were talking about all this crazy stuff they built. There wasn't much judgment. It was all, hey. Let's build cool stuff. Yeah. Exactly. There there was just a well, I mean, if you you know, even this the JavaScript based header parser was always sort of the holy grail for node because there was such a tax that was paid when you crossed the JavaScript SQL plus boundary. And I was like, well, it actually can be slower in JavaScript, and it's still gonna be faster for node's use case. So there's a lot of, like, pragmatism in, JavaScript that isn't necessarily there in other languages because when you're being told to do, you know, make it do x. And I was like, well, the only way for it to do x is to use this very arcane thing called XMLHT request. And then if I keep the socket open forever, even though that's never what it was intended to do, then I can get this thing that kind of feels like a persistent socket action. You know, it's this, like, weird yeah. I guess that's weird for pragmatism that doesn't always exist in other languages because in other languages, there is sort of a right way to do things and that everything else is the quote, unquote wrong way to do things. And you get looked at sideways doing it the wrong way whereas in JavaScript, you're like, well, you know, Ajax didn't really make any sense, but that was what worked. So we'll just do that. Is it another one of those? Maybe it is. Okay. Let's try that. Let's just do it. Let's just see what happens. Yeah. Because I started coding in Pearl in the nineties. And that was there's more than one way to do it. And then I ended up doing enterprise dev in Java. 10 years of my life. Gone. And it just felt so refreshing to come back to something like node. Oh, in fact, years before node, I had used NetScapes JavaScript Server solution. I can't remember what they called us. Do you remember that? No. I didn't I didn't use that one. In JavaScript. And this has gotta be, 98, maybe. I mean, that that was the idea. Right? And then it just, you know, the run times couldn't catch up to it. But, you know, I came into the JavaScript world. Probably, like, 2007 started, like, you know, being around people doing it. Rhino narwall, the early common JS debates, like, before everyone thought that common JS was just modules. Right? Like, common JS was actually a whole other set of interfaces that was designed for interoperability between these, you know, proto javascript run times. Rhino Norwall and then eventually node. This would be, like, the 1st 6 months of node. And over time, the thing that stuck around was modules because it was the one that was sort of the the most baked and there was the best and biggest need for it and it gave JavaScript the thing that in many ways, it still has today, which is not just interoperability, although there is sort of the I dreamed a dream of ESM, and that dream has gone from me. We spent a lot of time on that dream, quietly at GoDaddy. Brad Farris, back then, Brad Mack, was worked with us at GoDaddy. He worked with us, and he did a lot of work on that as did Miles. And, you know, a lot of people put into it, but the the challenge there, I think when you look at of the standard side of things. And I don't wanna speak ill of anybody, but when you look at the staging process for TC39 that came out after e s 6, Stage 3 has to be in 2 browsers unplugged. That staging process came out right after ESM lands in the spec with no staging process. So and the amount of other standards that needed to get written from the module loaders back to, you know, how are we gonna do their imports? All of those things were not TC39. They're what way there are other standards group out there. And I'm not throwing any of those people under the bus and ensure those debates needed to happen. But this idea that this thing, this was been, like, 2016, 2017, that isn't implemented anywhere, relitigating that portion of and only that portion of the back 1262 spec will break JavaScript or break the internet is an absurd fallacy that I think everyone who is, like, frustrated with the SM needs to realize, like, there was a period where we could have fixed this if there was some flexibility there. And I appreciate that don't break the internet ethos of the, you know, TC39 and echo 262 spec, but that one in particular because it was shipped so early. And, really, in many ways, was the forcing function for the staging. Process that I think is a great staging process today. We got what we got. And JavaScript's having its, Python 3 moment. That that that's the way I know. I know. Oh my god. Please stop. God save us. But in the early days, you had all sorts of interesting things, like IO OS, but then eventually it ended up. But in the end, it ended up under good stewardship. Was that just plain luck? Or what lesson can we take from large infrastructure style projects. I think that A vendor neutral home for most large sort of foundational pieces of software is the right choice. Like, when I heard that, PyTorch had landed as Atlantic's Foundation Collaborative Projects recently, I thought that was a great idea. And that was the result of a lot of hard work of building relationships with Meta. Starting with, I think, in many ways, the Graph Field Foundation followed closely behind by the OpenJAS Foundation, which became a home for, JES. And just showing that, like, there's a path there and that vendor neutral is a safe place, for things that are foundational for their business and for many other people's business. The node story and the node 4, Theodore, and Disney wasn't registered to employee before he moved on to brighter pastures Think about a year before he did the IHS for it. And I think having someone like that who is just so apolitical being the person that for to kind of sent the right message of, like, look, this is about the contributors. It's always been about the contributors. The lead up to the fork was the result of you just looked at the contributor numbers and they were going down for a variety of reasons. I don't wanna, you know, rehash old wounds, anything like that. But the reason I think that made it so seamless was the one thing that JavaScript had going for from the very beginning, which is that the semantics of the runtime prior to, I think, couple of years ago when you started to have these, what are the capabilities of the web and what capabilities of the web belong? In the server side run times, in the browser run times, etcetera. But back then, that that didn't really exist. It was like, look, if you have e s 5 and you have couple of browser primitives. And if you don't, if you want a browser primitive, you have to do some kind of up to check for it, you know, type of HTML, XML HP requests, it was undefined, that kind of stuff. To the, progressive enhancement version of the web. And that was progressive enhancement server progress too. But back then, you could just say, hey. Look. I'm gonna go look at npm for something, and it's gonna work. It's gonna work on my program. Whereas if you look at something like Python, Ruby, really, any other runs. Right? Yeah. You know, now Python has async IO, which is good. But there is still twisted. And there's other projects that have casing like capabilities. I don't really know where Ruby landed on async IO back then. There was a vent machine and, they have event, something like that. There was another there was 2 different events solutions for Ruby. And people that knew event machine really well could get performance similar to node because they didn't have to deal with all of, like, the thread pooling that came from having to run, like, an Apache on on top of it to do, you know, single threaded IO, blah blah blah. And they would you know, put up their samples and say, hey. Look. I made review as fast as no. It's like, yeah. But how many people can do that? Like, you and 10 other people because you have to know Oh, King's that library. King's that library. King's that library. King's that library. I have to cherry pick these things out of the ecosystem. Well, even And this is where, you know, there's some ignorance on my part of, like, where the pi pi boundary is and where, say, Kanda forge is, but my understanding is that not only is there multiple package managers, but there's also multiple published targets for packages. So that if just because you published something on IPI doesn't mean that you published it to conduct. Doesn't mean that you published it to other places that, you know, Python packages may be pulled from. And that in turn as I've gotten more, invested in, like, ML ops, data ops, sort of growing from my my early dev ops through building an early platform as a service with the clients that I work with, it's the best, you know, it kinda sounds crafty and, like, Yeah. My beard's not that great yet, but it's getting there. It's a little bit gray beard of me, but shipping packages and Python kinda feels like shipping packages to an operating system, like an operating system level package of, oh, I have to ship I have to ship the package 5 times. I need all this repackaging stuff. You're gonna truly ship a universal Python package, you would need to publish all of those places. And so you end up with these sort of, like, interesting federated ecosystems And because it's hard, people don't learn it. And so teams that I'm working with have, like, smart ML people, smart, you know, data science people. They don't really know the right way to set up a monorefo to publish through Python packages. And that was surprising to me because It's very different to know. So different. And but it does make sense because it it is even with, you know, 3 different package manager clients, PMPM, yarn, and PM, there's still one registry, and there's still a very simple wire protocol for that registry, which in many ways was based on, like, one of the optimal ways to build it, which is on top of like, it's still on top of couch and offer all couch to be shortcomings, building a package manager on top of it was actually still a really good. It's still a really good use case for you. And so I'm not trying to say, like, oh, cash to be this perfect database, but handles attachments and it handles documents up to several gigabytes. You really don't want them over like a gigabyte. That would be bad. But you can do a lot with with a couple 100 megabytes and, like, simple attachments. And I know in order to scale npm, I had to do all sorts of things that, you know, don't do that. You rip the attachments out of the main database and sort them as, you know, URLs, etcetera. But it works pretty well. And so one of the things when I was talking a lot with Miles Barnes about this in the days of DSM of like, why isn't there a standards group for package management? For all, like, what wait. Doesn't exist. Let's just It doesn't exist. Not like, oh, one for job script and one's like, really why we have containers. Why is there not a container equivalent? For software packages. I I still to this day, I don't know. The only answer that I can come up with is that it's taking a lot of people from a lot of different backgrounds where the choices are gonna lead to very diff, like, pretty big branches in implementation detail and getting all those people in a room to care about each other's use cases is very hard. And so that's my hypothesis why they they don't exist is that it's just it's a very diverse domain of problems. And simplifying it down would require a lot of sort of, you know, you're in the land of, like, SIMLink and hard SIMLink. And What does that mean on Windows and Linux and, you know, VST variants? And that world was very challenging. And and this is where when I talk about NPM, One of the things I I like to highlight is, you know, sort of as a pop quiz. What is underneath the covers? What is the best thing about npm? But, like, what it but, like, what does it do? Like, what does it it downloads? What What format does it download? They're local. They're local to your project. With that, but, like, it Isaac in his, you know, bad science crazy things we were doing back there. I was like, you know what? I'm gonna write a pure JavaScript tar implementation. That's a crazy thing to do. And because it's pure JavaScript, you don't have to deal with these, like, cross operating system variance of, like, oh, you need to install a TAR program on Windows and, oh, you have to, like, you need this TAR program on Linux, and you need this part program on macOS is like, oh, we have tarballs. Okay. I'm gonna write tar in JavaScript. And then the package the actual thing, the down to gzip and the, like, tar gzip, it's all native JavaScript or the c binding is built into the platform in the case of gzip. So you don't need this, like, you know, extra bit of install step. You went to install node, which comes with npm, which has the TAR implementation baked into it, and you're good to go. You don't need anything else. Whereas I think a lot of other like, packages, you know, they they've struggle with that sort of format. It's so seamless. It's there right in front of me, and I don't even notice because it all just works. And it was a hard thing to do. Writing, like, this was, I think, right around NPM 1.0 Like, you know what? The fact that we're still relying on the operating system tar, and I was like, okay. I mean, that sounds pretty tough, but, like, if that's where you think you need to go, you know, go for it. And I use it pretty frequently. It's it's a really nice implementation. Works the browser works in like, it just works. Do you think rust crates were inspired by node? Oh, I think I think there's, rest of the, you know, because that was all yahuda. So it's you you who is an interesting fellow because he had a a stint in JavaScript. I think I don't know if he's more versatile or JavaScript these days, but I think he's at the time was better known for his Ruby work. And then he went and worked at Amber for a while, and as part of that was on TC39. So he was instrumental in some of that finalization of the ES modules spec. And then from there, went to go work on rust and cargo and crates. I don't know if he's still working on it, but the early versions of cargo were were all yhuda. So that I think that he sort of got the full gamut because, you know, a lot of early node stuff is based on sort of that later Ruby stuff. Like, in many ways, connect and by proxy express and all express variants are just Sinatra. Yeah. Yeah. 100%. Is a name that, you know, nobody, because Sonatra merged, you know, with Merv or maybe Sinatra's still around, but Merv merged with rails and all sorts. Wow. It's the old, the old library stuff that, you know, like, the history of open source in many ways. But it's it's where people get their ideas from. And if you, you know, that's why I I like to call out this kind of thinking to people because I think in many ways, a lot of people just get convinced that they're stupid. That their idea is going back to the wire engineers not considered a creative trait of, like, they just get convinced that, like, oh, well, I have this idea, you know, blah blah blah. Oh, this is how it works now. It doesn't matter, like, how we made it. Not it's actually very important how we made it because how we get inspired, those kinds of things. And there's, an anecdote, I guess, I don't know if we're getting close to the end, but it it's a good closing anecdote, if we are close, you know, what did for the 50 years before Alan Turing did his work, you know, what was every mathematician on the planet obsessed with? Who's familiar with this? No. Proving proving based arithmetic. A mathematical proof for basic. Of course. Of course. Of course. Yeah. No. And, you know, tell you freaking, like, real, like, wait. Oh, really? Yeah. Like, for 50 years, every mathematician on China faced Griffith and Godell in his sort of trollishness, was, hey. I have I found it. I proved based arithmetic. Everyone come to this conference. And for, you know, those listening that don't know what I'm about to say, if he introduces something called godell's incompleteness theorem, which is the idea that proving base for arithmetic is impossible. You cannot prove it. And one of the people sitting in the audience is Alan Turing. And within 18 months, it's like, oh, great. I can stop wasting my time trying to prove based arithmetic. Within 18 months, He's, like, halfway there to prove, like, the church Turing thesis and the foundations of modern theoretical computer science. But he he was convinced that he needed to be solving this problem. And so whenever I try to get engineers to, you know, really think big, it's sort of like, well, what are the problems. What should we be doing? Just get them all in a room and ask very simple questions. What do you think we should be doing? Right. And I feel like Like, whatever I want whatever I think is like, yeah. Yeah. Like, whatever you think. And like, well, you know, it's really hard to get a local dev environment set up. It's like, well, they wish to fix that. You know, and it's it ends up being debt tools almost always. So node was the moment for that era of coding. But it feels like for machine learning, we really need the same sort moment. Right? Something that really captures the right way to do it. And to capture that thing about the node communities, which was it was completely democratic. I mean, anybody could contribute. That's what was so cool about it. At any level of coding skill. There's, there's a startup here in New York where I had the pleasure of running into from a a VC that we knew, and there was their 10 year anniversary a few weeks ago called Runhouse. You've seen this? It's just run run dot house, like, that they have the I thought using the dot house GTLD was very clever. But what they're trying to do is, almost like functions as a service of 5, some of these ML things, because in many ways, of all the workloads that were out there. I think back to the early node days. Like, I packages that I wrote that I I have not thought about in a long time. One of them was called package cloud. It was multi cloud interface for node. And it turns out that that was not a great thing to build because most workloads don't have a very high marginal elasticity for where you can get savings. Like, they're just they're gonna you're running on Amazon. You're running on Azure. You're running GCP. It's a web app. It it's gonna cost you pretty much the same amount of money. It's gonna run about the same. Like, there's there's not much difference. Data and, like, ML workloads are very sensitive to data access and have a lot of very bespoke data access problems, and they are very sensitive to chip architectures. And, you know, it's gonna do better on the gen 4 chip and Oh, it's finally kind of there, for that. And I was I was meeting with the founder. We just had coffee a couple weeks ago, and I was sort of saw this as it's a bit like framework defined infrastructure, you know, the Purcell buzzword, but for ML. And in ML case, I don't I'm not sure if I'm sold on it for the web case because, again, those workloads are very easy to move around. But in the case of ML, they are very sensitive. Like, hey. You're running this on, you know, some sort of parallelism or or, you know, this chip architecture gives you that thing or know, you have this version of those GPUs and you can prove this 10 to 25% faster. Yeah. Like, you should probably do that. Your training jobs go from, you know, 5 days to 2 days. Sure. But this way, it's packaged up by the framework. You don't have to worry about this, like, abtused layer of Python packaging that nobody really understands. It's a run house function or it's a run you know, so know, I I haven't played with it that much, but I think that that's where we're probably gonna start to see some innovation. So much of this problem space is just Python Packaging. And the funny part about it is that it's a lot of people that have never had to deal with active manager problems. Like, we actually had sort of a brain trust of people, you know, because you have Yahoo to come in who wrote Ruby Gems and did a ton of Ruby Gems work. You have, like, Isaac had done packaging work at Yahoo. And, like It was just a critical moment. Right? Who really knew hex offenders. Right? And there's not a lot of a Like, it's not a very glamorous problem. And ML, you have a lot of very smart data scientists, ML engineers, but there's not a lot of, like, hardcore computer science operating system people. Like, that's that's a different set of people. Not one's better or one's worse. They're just they don't you know, in the Venn diagram, there's very little overlap. And so if you don't know that your problem is way over here because you're focused on your, like, domain problem, then you may not realize that actually this is something over there. Like, I'll give you the, the high And it's actually like dealing with, like, a rag, like, a retrieval augmented generation system. Right? And having worked with them, it's it's this issue of the kind of unpredictable performance. Yeah. And I I was coaching somebody last week, but I'd love to hear quantitative I can prove to you that your data access is gonna be four times as fast at least by switching from, like, timescale to a document database because you don't actually have time. You have a monotonically increasing sequence number. And they're like, wait. Yeah. What? And I was like, look. You you you you just because they just saw a database. They saw time. They they're generating time series values, and so they thought, oh, time series, time scale, good database. You know, I was like, well, No. Because you generate those values regularly. So you have multiple value. And so, when they went and did the follow-up work on it. It turns out it's gonna be at least 6 times faster, potentially 20 times faster. So and I'm not very good at databases. I'm, like, okay at databases. You know, like, I'm not Jake, Chris Anderson. Like, I'm, I'm, like, okay at this stuff. In my mind anyway, but, like, in a room full of people who have never had to go and understand, like, you know, what that append only JSON store is and the characteristics of, you know, partition keys, it's hard. It's and this, you know, I'll I'll not like an Amazon shiller, but this is why I always push people to dynamo because every engineer Yeah. That was that have ever pushed to dynamo, they come out. They know how databases work. Because dynamo isn't really a database. It's like a it's almost like level d b. It's a little it's like it's lower level And I've, like, I asked people, like, what what's level d b? Do you know what that is? Like, what's what's that? Like, well, if you're into databases, there's this, like, weird layer in the middle that isn't the database. It's like the hardcore data access layer that, like, isn't exactly the file system, but it's, you know, like, what is level DB? Like, it it's a weird inter diary between stuff. So, yeah, I think that that's coming, and I think it has to come because the funny thing about all of this, and I've heard Bamil problems is that entropy. If you had told me that what's gonna kill Moore's law? Entropy. I'm like, what? The entropy. Turns out that's what it is. Because in order to get Moore's law to be accurate, you gotta stack it in three dimensions. And when you start stacking in three dimensions, the heat is so much that you actually have to run more energy through the chip. It's not linear. Goes up. So the data center cost for this next generation of computing and in, you know, by proxy, the climate impact of these data centers is gonna be more, not, like, same amount of work. But it's just gonna be more. So there is this, you know and this is my current space for green tech. I'll kinda end here. I think there is a coming, at least I hope there is sort of realization for many engineers out there. They're in the software field that how you approach these problems matter because you may end up impacting the climate. But literally. And so I mean, that's Responsible computing is is, you know, it's not it's very, Yeah. And we never had to worry about it before. Yeah. I mean, maybe we were overclocking back in the day. But to actually have an impact on a much more fundamental level. Right? Right. I am gonna say thank you, and good night. We have covered so much ground. I don't even know to where to start to introduce this. And it is interesting that you've observed in the machine learning space that it just needs hardworking down to earth engineers to make it really practical. We need to roll up her sleeves. Right? What we're waiting for is someone to do what was done for note. Right? And is there, like, taking the computer scientists and having them you know, I I don't I some of these tongue in cheek you know, descriptions that I have certainly can be viewed as, talking down to very smart ML folks, very smart data site. No things that I'll never know. You know, but the data scientists and computer scientists, not the same thing. And that's not a bad thing. Right? But it's that, like, data scientists solving all these hard ML problems with ML engineers, etcetera. But this, like, ML ops space that is there, It is, reminds me a lot of dev ops, like, 10, 12 years ago. No one really knows what it is. It's a little bit all over the place, and turns out a lot of what dev ops ended up being is like, You're using MySQL. Why are you using MySQL? That's bad. You know, like, just real basic computing problems because when you're being forced to maintain the system, you go like, this can't possibly be the right way to do this. This seems really wrong, and then you would have talked to people like, oh, yeah. You should, like, switch over Postgres. Postgres will make that a lot easier for you. And then now, you know, 10 years later, most people are Postgres. Obviously an oversimplification of some of the domains, but I think it's a lot of that of, like, people are like, well, I'll just use this. You know, SQL for everything. It's like, well, yeah, I mean SQL for, like, at least 50% of things, maybe 70, but, like, there's a 30% data problem. Like, that's why we use Cassandra and, you know, all these other alternative databases. They're not universal, but if your workload looks like this, you should probably use that. Okay. Okay. I eagerly await the solution. Eagerly await the solution. It is a it is a bit of a quagmire. Lots of fun, but Charlie, thank you so much. This is Thank you. Such a great to catch up.

If you want to find out what really happened when Mode burst onto the scene and managed to establish itself as a brand new software development platform. We take a deep dive into the wise and wherefors. Essential listening, if you're trying to establish your own proprietary or indeed open source platform today. And that was just the first topic.\n\nWe cover a whole bunch of ground. Alright, Charlie. Let's talk. Charlie. Welcome to the Fireside of FoxGeek podcast.\n\nIt is great to have you on. And to be talking again since, I think, well, pre COVID times. Yeah. Oh, definitely it's before COVID. So I invited you on because you had a front row seat to the early days of node.\n\nAnd how it took over the world and the setup of various foundations, and all of that stuff, and what fascinates me from a developer relations perspective is, why on earth did no JS managed somehow to take over the world. I mean, Ryan Dial did an amazing It's funny. Now that I think about it in in terms of DevRel or Dev advocacy, because my entry into node is a direct result of a complete and utter lack of that failure of that on behalf of Microsoft, back then. I Started my career at Microsoft. I worked on a very old, very dead piece of technology called Windows Presentation Foundation.\n\nAlthough, for the Microsoft dot net folks listening to this, probably not as old and dead as I'm saying it is, but this is, you know, 2005, 2006, and I drank the Kool Aid Heart. I worked at Microsoft right out of school, I worked on these things called X Baps, SAML based applications that ran inside of, active x in inner explorer. So really, like, webappifying it already. And then I went on to work, after the financial crash, paradoxically, I went into financial services, financial software consulting because as, my old boss, who, is now actually the CEO and founder of Greenhouse used to say consultants thrived at a downturn. And so this technology that was very new, the Microsoft was selling to everyone, WPF several light.\n\nI had, you know, light years more experience than other people. So I I was working with people, you know, 10, 12 years my senior on very notable pieces of financial software that, obviously, I can't talk about sort of who's and what's, but you name a a large bank here in the US and chances are it was a large front end application for their trading desk. And in doing so, we would find bugs and features, for some of these things that were It's called the source available, not open source. And I've worked at Microsoft, mind you. So sort of the tipping point for me, and if you go look at my GitHub profile, it's probably one of the oldest repositories that's there.\n\nIt was adding support for an insertable, interface on of, I'm sure, a very old dead framework of theirs. I think Blue's called Prism. And I've got it all together. You know, all the code, all the tests, and submitted my, you know, mercurial based, not even pull request to code plex. Only to be told that, they only accept changes from Microsoft employees.\n\nAnd that was sort of the end for me. I I didn't want, you know, I did it. I knew that it was right because I've been in my soft employee, and it's what they wanted. And sort of the, like, you know, beyond the CLA, which is, I know, a topic that comes up a lot in foundations of, like, we just literally we don't even have a CLA. We're just gonna say, if you don't work for us, we're done.\n\nAnd so I I flipped my table out, I was obviously polite about it, but I was like, okay. Well, if that's where you want me to put it, then, I can tell you where to put something else. You know? I was a GitHub user of 4628 or something like that. And it that was, like, the same week that all of this happened.\n\nAnd my roommate at the time was had been kind of the same as me, but all of these JavaScript. And I, you know, didn't really know JavaScript. I was like, oh, this prototype thing. That seems weird. And, then I think probably the month later was rise talk at JS Compu, so November 2009, and the, like, night and day of, like, community, like, the idea of it, or, like, people just like, I'm doing this.\n\nThat's cool. I'm doing this. I'm doing this other thing, and we, you know, just open free discourse about it versus, you know, the guarded walls of code plex that I had experienced was really the reason I got into it. And from there, it solidified my thinking that I must have told this story to investors and, you know, tons of people more times than I can count, but it was this thing that Microsoft was reporting would be, like, the next coming of, dot net was gonna die. And so, therefore, Flash and PLEX were gonna die.\n\nAnd this was before we knew that the iPhone was gonna kill Flash. So this thing that everyone kinda, like, laughs off called JavaScript, that's gonna win the front end. And when I had been doing all this work with these large banks, they loved the idea of one language. They love the, like, c sharp footage They would. Back end.\n\nYeah. They would. Yeah. Here comes this, like, JavaScript back end that everyone thinks is a joke. That's gonna take over.\n\nThat's gonna be the largest programming platform in the planet, and this was 2009 that I was thinking this. And by the time that We started the No JS Foundation. I remember having this conversation with Michael Rogers. I was like, oh, we are the largest programming platform on the planet. We are.\n\nThis is, like, 2015. Like, we are. The way it is. We have to just, like, find the numbers to prove that it is, but, like, we know that it is. And it was like, oh, I think it was NPM downloads compared to Maven downloads or something like that, but JavaScript had long been the number one language on GitHub.\n\nBut, Charlie, was it just that basic structural reason that JavaScript is the language of the browser? Did that make it Something's gotta win. There's there's a bit of a oligopoly to it of, like, where is their presentation stack? You know, why are we not all writing QT? Right?\n\nAnd But what it doesn't explain for me is why was the community so strong? That has to be a huge part of it. You know, in the early 20 tens, I have the same experience as you coming from Jeff. From this really strict clinical approach to, hey, do whatever you like. You know, let's be creative.\n\nYeah. I think it's the creativity part of it. And this is what I try to bring into engineer organizations that I work with now in my client base. Engineers are far more creative than people give them credit for. I think oftentimes you could hear sort of software engineer and accountant and think that it's, sort of the same same thing and that they're not at all.\n\nSorry for all the accountants out there. Maybe I'm I'm oversimplifying for you. You maybe really do wanna be a line tamer and modify someone's right. But, engineers are are it's it's a very creative thing to go do. And most people get convinced that they aren't creative because their ideas get squashed prematurely.\n\nThey don't have that a time to be like, well, this is I mean, I probably remember this term mad science. Right? This is kinda crazy. I don't know if it's gonna work. But I'm gonna work on this for a couple of days, and I'm gonna see if this is gonna work.\n\nLike, I don't know, a process monitor in pure JavaScript. That's kind of a crazy idea, but once you implement the c interface for detached child processes in, you know, ABB, it works. And, you know, it still has issues that, like, Upstart Vonet don't have because they're, like, baked into the operating system when they start, but once it's going, your operating system is good. And you put it in your upstart or monoscript, like, it works. And, I think if I was gonna do it all over again, I don't know if I write forever, but I certainly learned a lot writing it, and I'm a learn by doing kind of person.\n\nAnd I think that was the other part of it is that there were a lot of people in those early groups that were learned by doing. And that sort of, like, well, I don't know if that's gonna work, and I only know if it's gonna work if I see it working. So I might as well just try and make it work. Like, should I rewrite this very complex CHTP header parser in JavaScript? I don't know.\n\nBut why don't I do it four times? And I'll see if it's faster. And there was always acceptance, wasn't there? It seems to me. They were talking about all this crazy stuff they built.\n\nThere wasn't much judgment. It was all, hey. Let's build cool stuff. Yeah. Exactly.\n\nThere there was just a well, I mean, if you you know, even this the JavaScript based header parser was always sort of the holy grail for node because there was such a tax that was paid when you crossed the JavaScript SQL plus boundary. And I was like, well, it actually can be slower in JavaScript, and it's still gonna be faster for node's use case. So there's a lot of, like, pragmatism in, JavaScript that isn't necessarily there in other languages because when you're being told to do, you know, make it do x. And I was like, well, the only way for it to do x is to use this very arcane thing called XMLHT request. And then if I keep the socket open forever, even though that's never what it was intended to do, then I can get this thing that kind of feels like a persistent socket action.\n\nYou know, it's this, like, weird yeah. I guess that's weird for pragmatism that doesn't always exist in other languages because in other languages, there is sort of a right way to do things and that everything else is the quote, unquote wrong way to do things. And you get looked at sideways doing it the wrong way whereas in JavaScript, you're like, well, you know, Ajax didn't really make any sense, but that was what worked. So we'll just do that. Is it another one of those?\n\nMaybe it is. Okay. Let's try that. Let's just do it. Let's just see what happens.\n\nYeah. Because I started coding in Pearl in the nineties. And that was there's more than one way to do it. And then I ended up doing enterprise dev in Java. 10 years of my life.\n\nGone. And it just felt so refreshing to come back to something like node. Oh, in fact, years before node, I had used NetScapes JavaScript Server solution. I can't remember what they called us. Do you remember that?\n\nNo. I didn't I didn't use that one. In JavaScript. And this has gotta be, 98, maybe. I mean, that that was the idea.\n\nRight? And then it just, you know, the run times couldn't catch up to it. But, you know, I came into the JavaScript world. Probably, like, 2007 started, like, you know, being around people doing it. Rhino narwall, the early common JS debates, like, before everyone thought that common JS was just modules.\n\nRight? Like, common JS was actually a whole other set of interfaces that was designed for interoperability between these, you know, proto javascript run times. Rhino Norwall and then eventually node. This would be, like, the 1st 6 months of node. And over time, the thing that stuck around was modules because it was the one that was sort of the the most baked and there was the best and biggest need for it and it gave JavaScript the thing that in many ways, it still has today, which is not just interoperability, although there is sort of the I dreamed a dream of ESM, and that dream has gone from me.\n\nWe spent a lot of time on that dream, quietly at GoDaddy. Brad Farris, back then, Brad Mack, was worked with us at GoDaddy. He worked with us, and he did a lot of work on that as did Miles. And, you know, a lot of people put into it, but the the challenge there, I think when you look at of the standard side of things. And I don't wanna speak ill of anybody, but when you look at the staging process for TC39 that came out after e s 6, Stage 3 has to be in 2 browsers unplugged.\n\nThat staging process came out right after ESM lands in the spec with no staging process. So and the amount of other standards that needed to get written from the module loaders back to, you know, how are we gonna do their imports? All of those things were not TC39. They're what way there are other standards group out there. And I'm not throwing any of those people under the bus and ensure those debates needed to happen.\n\nBut this idea that this thing, this was been, like, 2016, 2017, that isn't implemented anywhere, relitigating that portion of and only that portion of the back 1262 spec will break JavaScript or break the internet is an absurd fallacy that I think everyone who is, like, frustrated with the SM needs to realize, like, there was a period where we could have fixed this if there was some flexibility there. And I appreciate that don't break the internet ethos of the, you know, TC39 and echo 262 spec, but that one in particular because it was shipped so early. And, really, in many ways, was the forcing function for the staging. Process that I think is a great staging process today. We got what we got.\n\nAnd JavaScript's having its, Python 3 moment. That that that's the way I know. I know. Oh my god. Please stop.\n\nGod save us. But in the early days, you had all sorts of interesting things, like IO OS, but then eventually it ended up. But in the end, it ended up under good stewardship. Was that just plain luck? Or what lesson can we take from large infrastructure style projects.\n\nI think that A vendor neutral home for most large sort of foundational pieces of software is the right choice. Like, when I heard that, PyTorch had landed as Atlantic's Foundation Collaborative Projects recently, I thought that was a great idea. And that was the result of a lot of hard work of building relationships with Meta. Starting with, I think, in many ways, the Graph Field Foundation followed closely behind by the OpenJAS Foundation, which became a home for, JES. And just showing that, like, there's a path there and that vendor neutral is a safe place, for things that are foundational for their business and for many other people's business.\n\nThe node story and the node 4, Theodore, and Disney wasn't registered to employee before he moved on to brighter pastures Think about a year before he did the IHS for it. And I think having someone like that who is just so apolitical being the person that for to kind of sent the right message of, like, look, this is about the contributors. It's always been about the contributors. The lead up to the fork was the result of you just looked at the contributor numbers and they were going down for a variety of reasons. I don't wanna, you know, rehash old wounds, anything like that.\n\nBut the reason I think that made it so seamless was the one thing that JavaScript had going for from the very beginning, which is that the semantics of the runtime prior to, I think, couple of years ago when you started to have these, what are the capabilities of the web and what capabilities of the web belong? In the server side run times, in the browser run times, etcetera. But back then, that that didn't really exist. It was like, look, if you have e s 5 and you have couple of browser primitives. And if you don't, if you want a browser primitive, you have to do some kind of up to check for it, you know, type of HTML, XML HP requests, it was undefined, that kind of stuff.\n\nTo the, progressive enhancement version of the web. And that was progressive enhancement server progress too. But back then, you could just say, hey. Look. I'm gonna go look at npm for something, and it's gonna work.\n\nIt's gonna work on my program. Whereas if you look at something like Python, Ruby, really, any other runs. Right? Yeah. You know, now Python has async IO, which is good.\n\nBut there is still twisted. And there's other projects that have casing like capabilities. I don't really know where Ruby landed on async IO back then. There was a vent machine and, they have event, something like that. There was another there was 2 different events solutions for Ruby.\n\nAnd people that knew event machine really well could get performance similar to node because they didn't have to deal with all of, like, the thread pooling that came from having to run, like, an Apache on on top of it to do, you know, single threaded IO, blah blah blah. And they would you know, put up their samples and say, hey. Look. I made review as fast as no. It's like, yeah.\n\nBut how many people can do that? Like, you and 10 other people because you have to know Oh, King's that library. King's that library. King's that library. King's that library.\n\nI have to cherry pick these things out of the ecosystem. Well, even And this is where, you know, there's some ignorance on my part of, like, where the pi pi boundary is and where, say, Kanda forge is, but my understanding is that not only is there multiple package managers, but there's also multiple published targets for packages. So that if just because you published something on IPI doesn't mean that you published it to conduct. Doesn't mean that you published it to other places that, you know, Python packages may be pulled from. And that in turn as I've gotten more, invested in, like, ML ops, data ops, sort of growing from my my early dev ops through building an early platform as a service with the clients that I work with, it's the best, you know, it kinda sounds crafty and, like, Yeah.\n\nMy beard's not that great yet, but it's getting there. It's a little bit gray beard of me, but shipping packages and Python kinda feels like shipping packages to an operating system, like an operating system level package of, oh, I have to ship I have to ship the package 5 times. I need all this repackaging stuff. You're gonna truly ship a universal Python package, you would need to publish all of those places. And so you end up with these sort of, like, interesting federated ecosystems And because it's hard, people don't learn it.\n\nAnd so teams that I'm working with have, like, smart ML people, smart, you know, data science people. They don't really know the right way to set up a monorefo to publish through Python packages. And that was surprising to me because It's very different to know. So different. And but it does make sense because it it is even with, you know, 3 different package manager clients, PMPM, yarn, and PM, there's still one registry, and there's still a very simple wire protocol for that registry, which in many ways was based on, like, one of the optimal ways to build it, which is on top of like, it's still on top of couch and offer all couch to be shortcomings, building a package manager on top of it was actually still a really good.\n\nIt's still a really good use case for you. And so I'm not trying to say, like, oh, cash to be this perfect database, but handles attachments and it handles documents up to several gigabytes. You really don't want them over like a gigabyte. That would be bad. But you can do a lot with with a couple 100 megabytes and, like, simple attachments.\n\nAnd I know in order to scale npm, I had to do all sorts of things that, you know, don't do that. You rip the attachments out of the main database and sort them as, you know, URLs, etcetera. But it works pretty well. And so one of the things when I was talking a lot with Miles Barnes about this in the days of DSM of like, why isn't there a standards group for package management? For all, like, what wait.\n\nDoesn't exist. Let's just It doesn't exist. Not like, oh, one for job script and one's like, really why we have containers. Why is there not a container equivalent? For software packages.\n\nI I still to this day, I don't know. The only answer that I can come up with is that it's taking a lot of people from a lot of different backgrounds where the choices are gonna lead to very diff, like, pretty big branches in implementation detail and getting all those people in a room to care about each other's use cases is very hard. And so that's my hypothesis why they they don't exist is that it's just it's a very diverse domain of problems. And simplifying it down would require a lot of sort of, you know, you're in the land of, like, SIMLink and hard SIMLink. And What does that mean on Windows and Linux and, you know, VST variants?\n\nAnd that world was very challenging. And and this is where when I talk about NPM, One of the things I I like to highlight is, you know, sort of as a pop quiz. What is underneath the covers? What is the best thing about npm? But, like, what it but, like, what does it do?\n\nLike, what does it it downloads? What What format does it download? They're local. They're local to your project. With that, but, like, it Isaac in his, you know, bad science crazy things we were doing back there.\n\nI was like, you know what? I'm gonna write a pure JavaScript tar implementation. That's a crazy thing to do. And because it's pure JavaScript, you don't have to deal with these, like, cross operating system variance of, like, oh, you need to install a TAR program on Windows and, oh, you have to, like, you need this TAR program on Linux, and you need this part program on macOS is like, oh, we have tarballs. Okay.\n\nI'm gonna write tar in JavaScript. And then the package the actual thing, the down to gzip and the, like, tar gzip, it's all native JavaScript or the c binding is built into the platform in the case of gzip. So you don't need this, like, you know, extra bit of install step. You went to install node, which comes with npm, which has the TAR implementation baked into it, and you're good to go. You don't need anything else.\n\nWhereas I think a lot of other like, packages, you know, they they've struggle with that sort of format. It's so seamless. It's there right in front of me, and I don't even notice because it all just works. And it was a hard thing to do. Writing, like, this was, I think, right around NPM 1.0 Like, you know what?\n\nThe fact that we're still relying on the operating system tar, and I was like, okay. I mean, that sounds pretty tough, but, like, if that's where you think you need to go, you know, go for it. And I use it pretty frequently. It's it's a really nice implementation. Works the browser works in like, it just works.\n\nDo you think rust crates were inspired by node? Oh, I think I think there's, rest of the, you know, because that was all yahuda. So it's you you who is an interesting fellow because he had a a stint in JavaScript. I think I don't know if he's more versatile or JavaScript these days, but I think he's at the time was better known for his Ruby work. And then he went and worked at Amber for a while, and as part of that was on TC39.\n\nSo he was instrumental in some of that finalization of the ES modules spec. And then from there, went to go work on rust and cargo and crates. I don't know if he's still working on it, but the early versions of cargo were were all yhuda. So that I think that he sort of got the full gamut because, you know, a lot of early node stuff is based on sort of that later Ruby stuff. Like, in many ways, connect and by proxy express and all express variants are just Sinatra.\n\nYeah. Yeah. 100%. Is a name that, you know, nobody, because Sonatra merged, you know, with Merv or maybe Sinatra's still around, but Merv merged with rails and all sorts. Wow.\n\nIt's the old, the old library stuff that, you know, like, the history of open source in many ways. But it's it's where people get their ideas from. And if you, you know, that's why I I like to call out this kind of thinking to people because I think in many ways, a lot of people just get convinced that they're stupid. That their idea is going back to the wire engineers not considered a creative trait of, like, they just get convinced that, like, oh, well, I have this idea, you know, blah blah blah. Oh, this is how it works now.\n\nIt doesn't matter, like, how we made it. Not it's actually very important how we made it because how we get inspired, those kinds of things. And there's, an anecdote, I guess, I don't know if we're getting close to the end, but it it's a good closing anecdote, if we are close, you know, what did for the 50 years before Alan Turing did his work, you know, what was every mathematician on the planet obsessed with? Who's familiar with this? No.\n\nProving proving based arithmetic. A mathematical proof for basic. Of course. Of course. Of course.\n\nYeah. No. And, you know, tell you freaking, like, real, like, wait. Oh, really? Yeah.\n\nLike, for 50 years, every mathematician on China faced Griffith and Godell in his sort of trollishness, was, hey. I have I found it. I proved based arithmetic. Everyone come to this conference. And for, you know, those listening that don't know what I'm about to say, if he introduces something called godell's incompleteness theorem, which is the idea that proving base for arithmetic is impossible.\n\nYou cannot prove it. And one of the people sitting in the audience is Alan Turing. And within 18 months, it's like, oh, great. I can stop wasting my time trying to prove based arithmetic. Within 18 months, He's, like, halfway there to prove, like, the church Turing thesis and the foundations of modern theoretical computer science.\n\nBut he he was convinced that he needed to be solving this problem. And so whenever I try to get engineers to, you know, really think big, it's sort of like, well, what are the problems. What should we be doing? Just get them all in a room and ask very simple questions. What do you think we should be doing?\n\nRight. And I feel like Like, whatever I want whatever I think is like, yeah. Yeah. Like, whatever you think. And like, well, you know, it's really hard to get a local dev environment set up.\n\nIt's like, well, they wish to fix that. You know, and it's it ends up being debt tools almost always. So node was the moment for that era of coding. But it feels like for machine learning, we really need the same sort moment. Right?\n\nSomething that really captures the right way to do it. And to capture that thing about the node communities, which was it was completely democratic. I mean, anybody could contribute. That's what was so cool about it. At any level of coding skill.\n\nThere's, there's a startup here in New York where I had the pleasure of running into from a a VC that we knew, and there was their 10 year anniversary a few weeks ago called Runhouse. You've seen this? It's just run run dot house, like, that they have the I thought using the dot house GTLD was very clever. But what they're trying to do is, almost like functions as a service of 5, some of these ML things, because in many ways, of all the workloads that were out there. I think back to the early node days.\n\nLike, I packages that I wrote that I I have not thought about in a long time. One of them was called package cloud. It was multi cloud interface for node. And it turns out that that was not a great thing to build because most workloads don't have a very high marginal elasticity for where you can get savings. Like, they're just they're gonna you're running on Amazon.\n\nYou're running on Azure. You're running GCP. It's a web app. It it's gonna cost you pretty much the same amount of money. It's gonna run about the same.\n\nLike, there's there's not much difference. Data and, like, ML workloads are very sensitive to data access and have a lot of very bespoke data access problems, and they are very sensitive to chip architectures. And, you know, it's gonna do better on the gen 4 chip and Oh, it's finally kind of there, for that. And I was I was meeting with the founder. We just had coffee a couple weeks ago, and I was sort of saw this as it's a bit like framework defined infrastructure, you know, the Purcell buzzword, but for ML.\n\nAnd in ML case, I don't I'm not sure if I'm sold on it for the web case because, again, those workloads are very easy to move around. But in the case of ML, they are very sensitive. Like, hey. You're running this on, you know, some sort of parallelism or or, you know, this chip architecture gives you that thing or know, you have this version of those GPUs and you can prove this 10 to 25% faster. Yeah.\n\nLike, you should probably do that. Your training jobs go from, you know, 5 days to 2 days. Sure. But this way, it's packaged up by the framework. You don't have to worry about this, like, abtused layer of Python packaging that nobody really understands.\n\nIt's a run house function or it's a run you know, so know, I I haven't played with it that much, but I think that that's where we're probably gonna start to see some innovation. So much of this problem space is just Python Packaging. And the funny part about it is that it's a lot of people that have never had to deal with active manager problems. Like, we actually had sort of a brain trust of people, you know, because you have Yahoo to come in who wrote Ruby Gems and did a ton of Ruby Gems work. You have, like, Isaac had done packaging work at Yahoo.\n\nAnd, like It was just a critical moment. Right? Who really knew hex offenders. Right? And there's not a lot of a Like, it's not a very glamorous problem.\n\nAnd ML, you have a lot of very smart data scientists, ML engineers, but there's not a lot of, like, hardcore computer science operating system people. Like, that's that's a different set of people. Not one's better or one's worse. They're just they don't you know, in the Venn diagram, there's very little overlap. And so if you don't know that your problem is way over here because you're focused on your, like, domain problem, then you may not realize that actually this is something over there.\n\nLike, I'll give you the, the high And it's actually like dealing with, like, a rag, like, a retrieval augmented generation system. Right? And having worked with them, it's it's this issue of the kind of unpredictable performance. Yeah. And I I was coaching somebody last week, but I'd love to hear quantitative I can prove to you that your data access is gonna be four times as fast at least by switching from, like, timescale to a document database because you don't actually have time.\n\nYou have a monotonically increasing sequence number. And they're like, wait. Yeah. What? And I was like, look.\n\nYou you you you just because they just saw a database. They saw time. They they're generating time series values, and so they thought, oh, time series, time scale, good database. You know, I was like, well, No. Because you generate those values regularly.\n\nSo you have multiple value. And so, when they went and did the follow-up work on it. It turns out it's gonna be at least 6 times faster, potentially 20 times faster. So and I'm not very good at databases. I'm, like, okay at databases.\n\nYou know, like, I'm not Jake, Chris Anderson. Like, I'm, I'm, like, okay at this stuff. In my mind anyway, but, like, in a room full of people who have never had to go and understand, like, you know, what that append only JSON store is and the characteristics of, you know, partition keys, it's hard. It's and this, you know, I'll I'll not like an Amazon shiller, but this is why I always push people to dynamo because every engineer Yeah. That was that have ever pushed to dynamo, they come out.\n\nThey know how databases work. Because dynamo isn't really a database. It's like a it's almost like level d b. It's a little it's like it's lower level And I've, like, I asked people, like, what what's level d b? Do you know what that is?\n\nLike, what's what's that? Like, well, if you're into databases, there's this, like, weird layer in the middle that isn't the database. It's like the hardcore data access layer that, like, isn't exactly the file system, but it's, you know, like, what is level DB? Like, it it's a weird inter diary between stuff. So, yeah, I think that that's coming, and I think it has to come because the funny thing about all of this, and I've heard Bamil problems is that entropy.\n\nIf you had told me that what's gonna kill Moore's law? Entropy. I'm like, what? The entropy. Turns out that's what it is.\n\nBecause in order to get Moore's law to be accurate, you gotta stack it in three dimensions. And when you start stacking in three dimensions, the heat is so much that you actually have to run more energy through the chip. It's not linear. Goes up. So the data center cost for this next generation of computing and in, you know, by proxy, the climate impact of these data centers is gonna be more, not, like, same amount of work.\n\nBut it's just gonna be more. So there is this, you know and this is my current space for green tech. I'll kinda end here. I think there is a coming, at least I hope there is sort of realization for many engineers out there. They're in the software field that how you approach these problems matter because you may end up impacting the climate.\n\nBut literally. And so I mean, that's Responsible computing is is, you know, it's not it's very, Yeah. And we never had to worry about it before. Yeah. I mean, maybe we were overclocking back in the day.\n\nBut to actually have an impact on a much more fundamental level. Right? Right. I am gonna say thank you, and good night. We have covered so much ground.\n\nI don't even know to where to start to introduce this. And it is interesting that you've observed in the machine learning space that it just needs hardworking down to earth engineers to make it really practical. We need to roll up her sleeves. Right? What we're waiting for is someone to do what was done for note.\n\nRight? And is there, like, taking the computer scientists and having them you know, I I don't I some of these tongue in cheek you know, descriptions that I have certainly can be viewed as, talking down to very smart ML folks, very smart data site. No things that I'll never know. You know, but the data scientists and computer scientists, not the same thing. And that's not a bad thing.\n\nRight? But it's that, like, data scientists solving all these hard ML problems with ML engineers, etcetera. But this, like, ML ops space that is there, It is, reminds me a lot of dev ops, like, 10, 12 years ago. No one really knows what it is. It's a little bit all over the place, and turns out a lot of what dev ops ended up being is like, You're using MySQL.\n\nWhy are you using MySQL? That's bad. You know, like, just real basic computing problems because when you're being forced to maintain the system, you go like, this can't possibly be the right way to do this. This seems really wrong, and then you would have talked to people like, oh, yeah. You should, like, switch over Postgres.\n\nPostgres will make that a lot easier for you. And then now, you know, 10 years later, most people are Postgres. Obviously an oversimplification of some of the domains, but I think it's a lot of that of, like, people are like, well, I'll just use this. You know, SQL for everything. It's like, well, yeah, I mean SQL for, like, at least 50% of things, maybe 70, but, like, there's a 30% data problem.\n\nLike, that's why we use Cassandra and, you know, all these other alternative databases. They're not universal, but if your workload looks like this, you should probably use that. Okay. Okay. I eagerly await the solution.\n\nEagerly await the solution. It is a it is a bit of a quagmire. Lots of fun, but Charlie, thank you so much. This is Thank you. Such a great to catch up.\n\nScary, but fascinating. Thank you so much. Take care. Bye bye. Take care.\n\nYeah. Good catching up. Bye.
